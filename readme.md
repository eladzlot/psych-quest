# Psych-Quest: Online Psychological Questionnaires

This repository hosts a collection of psychological self-report questionnaires, designed for easy online completion.
Each questionnaire is presented on a minimalist HTML page and allows users to **complete the form**, **view their total score**, and **download a PDF summary** of their responses.
This summary can be shared with a therapist or used for personal reflection.

All questionnaires are implemented client-side â€” no data is stored or transmitted.
